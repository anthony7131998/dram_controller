Notes for running our simulation:

Run the script file on the terminal to get the display outputs from our testbench. The script is named run_sim.

If seeing the waveforms is desired, then simply copy paste the contents from our tck file, sim.tcl, 
and run them in the modelsim terminal. This will show all the wave's simulations where one can
analyze signals individually.

NOTE: For the above to work you must be in our scripts directy of our submmision.
Meaning: you must be in  the directory dram_controller/scripts in order for any of these actions to work
**The simulation takes a long time so some patience is required. We simulated it to run
  up till 125ms, which is very large amount of cycles in the scope of our design.
  It is possible you will have to wait for upwards of 10 minutes ****
